I am Lasking and i created this new type of Prime number that connect Triangle,Square and Primes all together
Prue primes are primes that have special constraints.
If you add 2 to the prime you get a square number.
And if you subtract 2 you get Triangular number.
So this is a cool type of prime number The coolest.]

But i ask you... is there an infinite amount
